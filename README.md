# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Image-Classification

## Project Description

This project was part of an assignment for the course "Machine Learning Using Python", arranged by the ICT Division, Bangladesh. In this project, a dataset containing 1,000 images of cats and dogs was classified into two classes using 1 to 4 convolutional layers. The primary objective was to observe the change in model accuracy with respect to the number of convolutional layers used.
